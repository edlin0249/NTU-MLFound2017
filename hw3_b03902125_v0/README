Type command:
Q7.py:python3 Q7.py
Q8.py:python3 Q8.py [hw3_train.dat.txt path] [hw3_test.dat.txt path] [learning rate]
Q9.py:python3 Q9.py [hw3_train.dat.txt path] [hw3_test.dat.txt path] [learning rate]
[learning rate] = 0.01 or 0.001
[hw3_train.dat.txt path] = ./hw3_train.dat.txt or others
[hw3_test.dat.txt path] = ./hw3_test.dat.txt or others
python3.6 needs to import sys, numpy, matplotlib, and pylab packages in the testing environment, so the testing environment must install those packages first.
